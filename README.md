# 🚀 IPC Debugger - Operating Systems Project

## 📌 Introduction
**IPC Debugger** is a tool designed to analyze and debug **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms** in operating systems. It helps visualize and monitor communication between processes using various IPC techniques, making debugging and performance analysis easier.  

The project provides an **interactive and user-friendly interface** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python**, allowing users to track message exchanges, shared memory interactions, and process synchronization in real time.

## 🔥 Features
- ✅ **Real-time IPC Monitoring:** Observe how processes communicate.
- ✅ **Supports Multiple IPC Mechanisms:** Pipes, Shared Memory, Message Queues, and Sockets.
- ✅ **Interactive UI:** Visual representation of communication flows.
- ✅ **Process Logging:** Capture and analyze inter-process messages.
- ✅ **Debugging Assistance:** Identify deadlocks, race conditions, and performance bottlenecks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python  
- **IPC Mechanisms Covered:**  
  - **Pipes** (Anonymous & Named)  
  - **Message Queues**  
  - **Shared Memory**  
  - **Sockets** (TCP/UDP)  


## 🎮 How It Works
1. **Select IPC Mechanism:** Choose Pipes, Message Queues, Shared Memory, or Sockets.
2. **Run the Debugger:** Monitor process communication in real time.
3. **Analyze Logs:** Review messages exchanged between processes.
4. **Identify Issues:** Detect synchronization problems and bottlenecks.
5. **Optimize Performance:** Improve IPC efficiency using insights from logs.
